mfoilp
======

Installation:
=============

To run mfoilp you first need to install both SCIP and Mercury.
SCIP is available here: http://scip.zib.de/
Mercury is available here: https://mercurylang.org/

mfoilp has only been tested with the most recent versions of both
systems: SCIP3.2.0 and Mercury 14.01.1. It has only been tested using
Linux.

You should ensure that the Mercury compiler "mmc" is on your path. All
mfoilp source files should be put in the same directory. In that
directory you should create a symbolic link called "scip" which points
to wherever you have installed SCIP. For example:

ln -s /usr/userfs/j/jc33/local/src/scipoptsuite-3.2.0/scip-3.2.0 scip

Solving with mfoilp:
====================

To solve a problem instance, you need to (1) create a Mercury source file
which defines the problem (2) save this file with the name "prob.m" in
the same directory as the mfoilp files and (3) type "make solution" at
the command line.

If you have CPLEX installed you can do "make solution LPS=cpx" so that
CPLEX is used to solve the LPs.

Example problem instances
=========================

Four problem instances can be found in the directory
example_probs. The problem instance "ie.m" uses the 5 files
jntinfcandidates, similartitles, similarvenues, tokens and weights
which define data for the problem.

To get started copy one of these problem instances to "prob.m" in the
mfoilp directory (for ie.m copy also its 5 accpompanying files) and do
"make solution". (If something goes wrong, try doing a "make clean"
first.)
